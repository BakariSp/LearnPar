🎨 Visual Style Guidelines
Color Palette

Primary Accent: Bright orange #FFA336 (used in buttons and highlights)

Background: White #FFFFFF

Text:

Main headings: Dark green-gray #4A5744

Subtext/Secondary: Medium gray #6F736E

Interactive Elements: Orange dot indicators and highlights

Typography

Use a rounded sans-serif font similar to Inter or Nunito.

Heading: Bold, large size (e.g. 24–32px)

Body text: Medium weight, 14–16px

Card & Section Styling

Use rounded white cards with subtle box shadows for elevation

Padding around content should be generous (16px+)

Section titles (e.g. “icebreaking”) use smaller label style, lowercase, gray color

Add spacing between sections to create a sense of separation

Interaction

Include a subtle hover effect (e.g., shadow grow or background lighten)

Maintain consistency with the search bar and course recommendation layout

Buttons should use orange with white text and fully rounded corners

Layout

Align left with consistent vertical rhythm (just like the card layout)

If possible, keep spacing and visual hierarchy as clean and minimalist as the home screen

Keep the left-aligned time indicators (“3 days”, “5 days”) with pill-shaped style

💡 Behavior
Retain the logical structure: Course -> Sections -> Cards

Only show number of cards per section (don’t expand by default)

Add toggle to expand cards if needed (arrow or “show cards”)
